#- This script is started in the background immediately before

#- the server within the container is started

#-

#- This is useful to implement any logic that needs to occur after the

#- server is up and running

#-

#- For example, enabling replication in PingDirectory, initializing Sync

#- Pipes in PingDataSync or issuing admin API calls to PingFederate or PingAccess
